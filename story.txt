Late one night, I was out walking my Hund(dog) when suddenly I picked up the alluring scent of Bratwurst(german sausage).
I realized that I was near Flughafen(airport) in a cold weather with Apfelkuchen(apple pie) in one hand.
Then I saw a Baekerei(bakery) and decided to buy more Gebaeck(pastry) and Brot(bread) for my friend, his name is Highrise Mehlhase (german surname) and he lived in a Scholss (german castle) near Berlin (capital city).
