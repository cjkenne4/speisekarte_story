Late one night, I was out walking my Hund(dog) when suddenly I picked up the alluring scent of Bratwurst(german sausage).
I realized that I was near Flughafen(airport) in a cold weather with Apfelkuchen(apple pie) in one hand.
Then I saw a Baekerei(bakery) and decided to buy more Gebaeck(pastry) and Brot(bread) for my friend, his name is Highrise Mehlhase (german surname) and he lived in a Scholss (german castle) near Berlin (capital city).  
I loaded the Gebaeck(pastry) in my BMW and set off down the Hauptstrasse(main road), excited to see my Freund.  
We met at the local Ratskeller(a bar in the cellar or basement of a German town hall) to listen to Rammstein(ramming stone, also the name of a German heavy metal band) perform Du Hast.
We joined the Wettbewerbsfähig(competitive) trivia contest and miraculously won the first-place prize: a new Porsche(car).
The car Porsche Schloss(lock) was state of the art, it took us a minute to figure out how to open it.
We continued down the Hauptstrasse in our new Porsche blasting the Klimaanlage(air conditioning).  
I secured the Sicherheitsgurt across my lederhose and raced back down the Hauptstrasse  
Riding high, I realized the only thing that could have made that night better: A big old Bratwurst! (German Sausage)  
We parked at the Flughafen (airport) where we saw a Hund (dog).
As we approached him, his tail wagged happily and I realized he was my Hund, carrying something in his mouth: 3 juicy Bratwürste, one for each of us!
